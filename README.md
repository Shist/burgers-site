# burgers-site

React App with the page that consists of different burger meals.

---

### This project is hosted using the Vecel.com platform, you can see how it works here:

## https://shist-your-meal.vercel.app/

## Attention! Since the server side of the project works locally (http://localhost:4000) only after running the "npm run start-back" command in the terminal, the hosting site does not have access to the json server. So that is normal to run into the error "TypeError: Failed to fetch" while trying to load food data or log in or register a new account.
